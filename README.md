# json-converter
#test information

# This repo contains the 2 .py files, sample input data, an intermediate file, and sample output data to convert a .csv into a very specific .json format

# The name of the game here was "quick and dirty". With more time, I would combine the two .py files and thus make the intermediate "Resultant_file.csv" unnecessary. I would also create a separate .csv file such that I would not hard-code in certain values in the "csvCreator.py"
